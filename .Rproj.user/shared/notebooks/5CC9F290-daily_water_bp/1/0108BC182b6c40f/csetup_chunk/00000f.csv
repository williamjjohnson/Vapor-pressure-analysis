Error, nc-config not found or not executable.  This is a script that comes with the
netcdf library, version 4.1-beta2 or later, and must be present for configuration
to succeed.
 
If you installed the netcdf library (and nc-config) in a standard location, nc-config
should be found automatically.  Otherwise, you can specify the full path and name of
the nc-config script by passing the --with-nc-config=/full/path/nc-config argument
flag to the configure script.  For example:
 
"
"1","./configure --with-nc-config=/sw/dist/netcdf4/bin/nc-config
 
Special note for R users:
-------------------------
To pass the configure flag to R, use something like this:
 
R CMD INSTALL --configure-args=""--with-nc-config=/home/joe/bin/nc-config"" ncdf4
 
where you should replace /home/joe/bin etc. with the location where you have
installed the nc-config script that came with the netcdf 4 distribution.
