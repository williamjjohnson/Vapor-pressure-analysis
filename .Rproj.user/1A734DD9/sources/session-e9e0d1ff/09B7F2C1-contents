## Defining boiling point

The boiling point of a substance is the temperature at which the vapor pressure 
of that substance is equal to atmospheric pressure. This relationship can be 
described with the Clausius-Clapeyron Equation.

$ln(\frac{P_1}{P_2}) = \frac{\Delta H_{vap}}{R}(\frac{1}{T_2}-\frac{1}{T_1})$ 

The enthalpy of vaporization of water $\Delta H_{vap} = 40.7 \frac{kJ}{mol}$
and the gas constant $R = 8.3145 \frac{J}{mol K}$

The vapor pressure of water is 1.0 atm at 373 K. We can use this known 
relationship to calculate the daily boiling point of water with the 
Clausius-Clapeyron Equation. NCAR records the daily atmospheric pressure in 
units of inches of mercury. 1.0 atm = 29.9213 in Hg

```{r}
nc_data <- nc_open("weather_data/flab.20230101.nc")
t <- ncvar_get(nc_data, "time")
pressure <- ncvar_get(nc_data, "pres")
pressure_0101 <- tibble(time_seconds = t,
                        pressure_hPa = pressure)
```
